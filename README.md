# traffic_sign_detection

Using "Road Sign Detection" dataset from Kaggle, linked here:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/road-sign-detection

# Models I'm Using
- YOLOv7
- SVM
- SVM with HOG
- Custom Keras Model

(I wanted to use Caffe from UC Berkeley but was unable to get it working with my dataset)


# Things I want to compare:
- Data type
- Attributes about how they're built
- Difficulty in preprocessing
- Difficulty to implement
- Training time
- Accuracy
- Ease of deployment for future applications
